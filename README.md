# Thirsty Wine Website Automation Testing

## Project Title: Thirsty Wine

### Introduction
The **Thirsty Wine** website is an e-commerce platform where users can browse, search, purchase, and review various wines. The website also offers features like user registration, login, order management, payment processing, and customer support. This test plan outlines the **manual and automation testing** strategy to ensure that all core functionalities work as expected, are user-friendly and perform efficiently across different devices and browsers.

### Project Type
This project focuses on both **manual and automated testing** of the Thirsty Wine website's front end. It follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** for structuring automation tests in **Cypress**, ensuring maintainability and reusability. The testing covers **functionality, usability, and cross-browser/device compatibility**, with **BDD Cucumber** used for clear test specifications.
